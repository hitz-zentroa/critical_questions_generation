Delta) with my child and had no problems, though some anxiety. Delta's policy is to create a peanutfree buffer three rows in front & three rows behind the peanutallergic person.  One flight happened to be peanutfree because there were several passengers on the flight with peanut allergies, and the buffer zones pretty much took up the entire plane.  The other flights were not peanutfree.What I do for flights:  Carry all necessary medication, including at least two selfinjectors (I get Twinjects because two injectors have four doses.)  Let the airline know at the time of my reservation of our allergies and that I plan to board early.   Mention this again at the gate.   Bring Clorox wipes and clean my daughter's seat, tray table etc. and the seats on either side or window/wall if she has a window seat.  Bring food so we don't have to rely on the airline food. As mentioned by someone previously, banning peanuts is a slippery slope because there are many people with lifethreatening allergies to many foods. Shellfish allergies are more common in adults than peanuts.Someone wrote above \"As for the 'slippery slope' argument  I don't buy it. I've never heard of anyone having a wheat allergy going into anaphylaxis from someone sitting next to them eating a sandwich.\"Interesting point, but I can turn it around as I have never heard of a documented case of anyone going into anaphylaxis from airborne contact of peanuts. From what I understand, airborne anaphylaxis is very rare.If anything, I would suggest a ban on warming up peanuts, since that is more likely to put peanut proteins in the air. I would also suggest training staff to be sensitive to passengers with allergies.  They should create allergy policies and post them in an easily findable place on their websites (most have them, it's just tough to find on their sites) and be consistent so a passenger doesn't think she is flying on a nutfree flight when it isn't. And while this forum is great, I would weigh more the advice of researchers.
