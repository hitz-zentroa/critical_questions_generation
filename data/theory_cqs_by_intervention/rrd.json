The only known registry of deaths from anaphylaxis noted 33 deaths between 1994 and 1999. Remember, all of these estimates refer to the total number of people who had an anaphylactic reaction for any reason, not just from peanuts or other foods.\"\nbut I have yet to find anything I can pin down that says how many people REALLY die from a peanut allergy each year.\nTo me it seems pretty obvious that people with peanut allergies do fly (as many here have stated they do)\nand yet as far as I can tell no one has died.\nSo, why are we even discussing banning peanuts when they have not killed a single person on an airplane?\nOnce again we see the attitude of everyone must change for a few, a very few.\nThis allergy is yours and yours to deal with,\nwhy in the world do you expect all of the rest of us to change anything in our own lifestyles to accommodate you?\nAs it is, you have a solution,\nyou take Benadryl when you fly.\nGreat.\nOther people need to take other medication to fly as well to deal with their own issues/problems also which they have no control over.\nShould we therefore make exceptions for all of them as well?\nI say no.\nThere are steps you can personally take to deal with your own allergy\nbut instead you insist that everyone else take steps so that you don't have to.\nSorry, I'm not accepting that.\"",
